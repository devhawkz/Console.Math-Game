# Console.Math-GameIn your first project you’ll build a very simple Math Game app. If this is your first time building a project indepentently, I recommend making use of the C# Academy's series from our C# Foundation area.This series will guide you through the process of creating a console app from the ground up, while explaining crucial C# concepts. If you have already watched it, or if you have prior experience creating C# applications, this project will be a breeze. But it’s still helpful to reinforce your knowledge.

You'll find challenges at the end of this project and all other projects in The C# Academy. These challenges aren't requirements. Your project will still be approved and you'll gain the correspondent experience points. However, the challenges will reinforce what you've learned. Although you might not get extra points for completing them, you'll become a better developer each time you finish a challenge.


Requirements
 You need to create a Math game containing the 4 basic operations
 The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go from 0 to 100. Example: Your app shouldn't present the division 7/2 to the user, since it doesn't result in an integer.
 Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation
 You should record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games.
 You don't need to record results on a database. Once the program is closed the results will be deleted.

Resources
If you have previous C# experience, you might be able to complete this project without any help. If you don't, follow this tutorial:

You don't need to watch the second part of this tutorial (Building a .NET Maui app), to complete this project. Only the Console App is required


Tips
 Don't forget to ALWAYS, I mean ALWAYS have your code saved on Github (or whatever source control you use). This way you won't lose your work, and you can always refer back to it in the future. You're building a library of your own!
 Don't rush through the steps, even if this tutorial is easy for you. Make sure you understand EACH WORD of the code. Leave no stone unturned.
 If there's anything you don't understand, hover over the code, and you'll get an explanation of what the term means. If you still can't understand it, google is your best friend. You'll find explanations about pretty much everything in forums like stackoveflow.com.
 If this is your first project, I recommend doing it twice. You'll be surprised at how much your retention increases, and how many gaps were left in the first time.
 Upon completion of your project, go to our Discord community and brag about it! It's a very important step to complete a project and you should celebrate.

Challenges
 Try to implement levels of difficulty.
 Add a timer to track how long the user takes to finish the game.
 Add a function that let's the user pick the number of questions.
 Create a 'Random Game' option where the players will be presented with questions from random operations

Source Control
If this is your first tutorial, you might be tempted to skip this step and start coding. Don’t do it or you’ll learn the hard way. One day after working for many hours on a difficult problem you won’t save your work on a source control repository and for whatever reason all of it will be lost.

Get into the habit of saving every line of code you ever write. I promise it will save you from many headaches. All serious developers save their work on a backup repository. The most commonly used is Github. Create an account if you haven’t yet.

1. In Visual Studio, go to Git > Create Git Repository
2. Enter your Login Details
3. Click on Create and Push.

✅ Done! Your repository is good to go. Don’t forget to commit and push your changes after every step!

You can take further step and learn how to integrate Github with Visual Studio watching this tutorial:



Code Review
If you want your code to be reviewed by a member of the C# Academy, instead of creating your own repository, follow this article, where you’ll learn how to create a fork from our base review repository.
